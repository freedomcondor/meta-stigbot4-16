this is a little program that sets up a server on the robot, 
letting you control the speed of the robot through tcp. 

	layout like this:

		PC(where a control console program is running)
			|
			|tcp
			|
		linux on robot (where this program is running)
			|
			|uart
			|
		dds on board

in both tcp and uart, 4 bytes is transfered forward and received back to 
set the speed and get the measure feedback
